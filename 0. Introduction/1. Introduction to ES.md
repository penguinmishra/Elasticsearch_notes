# Introduction to ES
- ES is analytics and full text search engine. Often used to enable search functionality for applications.
- A powerful search engine could be built with ES
- NOt just that, you could also query structural data and use ES as analytics platform tool. YOu could write queries that aggregates data and use the results to make pie-charts etc

- An example for further use of ES is to store and analyse application logs and system metrics. Such as Errors and CPU/Memory usage which is called Application Performance Management (APM).
- Another common thing to do is to send events to ES. These events could be anything. Perhaps we are sending sales from stores to ES in which case we can analyse which store sales the most. Which is known as aggregation similar to that in RDBMS:

- ES is great at analysing lots of data. It can be used with ML to forecast future values. Perhaps you are maintaining how many calls were made to support department. That data could be used to check as and when you need more capacity. Or perhaps keeping a track of visitors on a website and forecasting when you would need a new server.

- Another thing that can be done is anomality detection. Let ML learn the norm and it'll alert you when an anomality occurs. This could be done by setting up an alert system.

## How ES works

- data is stored as document which contains fields which corresponds to columns in RDBMS.

- Querying in ES is to use REST API:

- ES is written in Java and built on top of Apache Lucene.
- Since ES is distributed in nature, it scales very well in terms of increased data volumes and query throughput.
