## Searching with regex

example:<br>
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "regexp": {
      "tags.keyword": "Veget[a-zA-Z]+le"
    }
  }
}
```

- ES uses Lucene's regex engine and some features are not supported such as character classes (`\d` etc) and anchor character (`$` etc)<br><br>

:triangular_flag_on_post: Performance

- While using regex, performance should be kept in mind.
- Performance depends on how efficient the regex pattern is.
- Try not using wildcards (`*`) in your pattern.
- Try using a long prefix before `*` if possible because this will heavily improve performance.
- Avoid including wildcards at the beginning of pattern since it is a performance killer.
