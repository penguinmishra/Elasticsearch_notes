##  Matching based on prefix

- `"prefix"` allows to search documents that contain a term within a given field that begins with the given prefix.
- Query is not limited to searching fields containing a single term but will also match documents that have 10 words within the field of any of the term beginning with the specified prefix.

example:

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "prefix": {
      "tags.keyword": "Vege" 
    }
  }
}
```
Since the keywords are not analyzed, the value is case-sensitive.
