## Searching with wildcards

- Lets us add wildcards in terms.
- `*` - any character sequence including no character
- `?` - matches a single character
examples:
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "wildcard": {
      "tags.keyword": "Veg*ble"
    }
  }
}

GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "wildcard": {
      "tags.keyword": "Veget?ble"
    }
  }
}
```
**Wildcard queries can be slow because it needs to iterate through a lot of terms.**<br><br>
:no_entry: If you put `*` or ? at the beginning of the term to be searched, it can lead to slow queries and we should avoid doing it.
