## Working with relative dates (date math)

We can make use of relative dates which is called as date math. It is not exclusive or specific to range query as date math can be used in other parts of ES as well.<br>
We can use the date math by specifying date expression consisting of an *anchor date*.

#### `anchor date` or `anchor point`
- this is a point in time that we want to use as basis for a date calculation i.e. starting point.
- This date point can be in one of 2 formats:
	- keyword `now`
	- `date string` that we mention in `gte`, `lte` etc.
- If we use date string, we need to add two trailing pipes `||` to indicate the end of the anchor date to help ES while parsing the expression. It is not a logical `OR`.
- for example, `2010/01/01||` in this `2010/01/01` is anchor date.
- Math expression can be used with the anchor date such as `+1d`, `-1y` etc. They could be combined such as `-1d-1y`.

#### Rounding off the dates

- We can round off the dates as well by appending a forward slash and date time unit.
- for example, a query may supply date including time in which case you can round the time off to midnight by appending `/d` to the date expression: `2010/01/01||/d`. `/M` for month and `/m` for minutes are others.
- generally values are rounded down but in context of range queries the rounding off depends on the parameter that the date is added for (`gt`,`gte`,`lt`,`lte`)

- In above, rounding off is done for a month.
- NOTE: though the example only shows dates, ES will still round to the time values as well, internally. That's because the ES stores and calculates the date based on the number of miliseconds since the epoch.
- Rounding off can be done before or after adding/subtracting the days/years etc: `2010/01/01||/M-1y`, `2010/01/01||-1/M`, `now/M-1y`, `now` are some examples.

# From documentation:
the following search returns documents where the timestamp field contains a date between today and yesterday.<br>
```
GET _search
{
    "query": {
        "range" : {
            "timestamp" : {
                "gte" : "now-1d/d",
                "lt" :  "now/d"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Elasticsearch rounds date math values in parameters as follows:

##### `gt`
- Rounds up to the lastest millisecond.
- For example, `2014-11-18||/M` rounds up to `2014-11-30T23:59:59.999`, excluding the entire month.
##### `gte`
- Roundds down to the first millisecond.
- For example, `2014-11-18||/M` rounds down to `2014-11-01`, including the entire month.
##### `lt`
- Rounds down to the first millisecond.
- For example, `2014-11-18||/M` rounds down to `2014-11-01`, excluding the entire month.
##### `lte`
- Rounds up to the lastest millisecond.
- For example, `2014-11-18||/M` rounds up to `2014-11-30T23:59:59.999`, including the entire month.

## Date Math
Most parameters which accept a formatted date value - such as `gt` and `lt` in `range` queries, or from and to in daterange aggregations - understand date maths.<br><br>
The expression starts with an anchor date, which can either be `now`, or a date string ending with `||`. This anchor date can optionally be followed by one or more maths expressions:
`+1h`: Add one hour
`-1d`: Subtract one day
`/d` : Round down to the nearest day

Assuming now is `2001-01-01 12:00:00`, some examples are:

[]()                 |
---------------------|---------------------
`now+1h`              | now in milliseconds plus one hour. Resolves to: `2001-01-01 13:00:00`
`now-1h`              | now in milliseconds minus one hour. Resolves to: `2001-01-01 11:00:00`
`now-1h/d`            | now in milliseconds minus one hour, rounded down to `UTC 00:00`. Resolves to: `2001-01-01 00:00:00`
`2001.02.01\|\|+1M/d` | `2001-02-01` in milliseconds plus one month. Resolves to: `2001-03-01 00:00:00`
