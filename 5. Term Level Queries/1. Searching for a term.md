## Searching for a term

Term level queries can be specified in 2 ways:
1.
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term":{
      "is_active" : true
    }
  }
}
```
and
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term":{
      "is_active":{
        "value" : true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
It's possible to search terms within text fields usually for enum fields such as status, containing either active, paused or disabled for instance.<br>
Query for fields of the type keyword can be done because these are not analyzed. Since terms level queries are also not analyzed, we'll get predictable matches.<br>
You can use term queries for full text fields as well but this is rarely a good idea because such fields are analyzed and the query is not.<br>
Term queries are used mostly for numbers, dates and keyword fields.<br>
Term level queries can be used to query text fields also.
