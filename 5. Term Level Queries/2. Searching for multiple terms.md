## Searching for multiple terms

We provide an array of values instead of a single value. Document will match if it contains any of the supplied values within the filed that was specified.<br><br>
ES maps each text field both as a full text field and a keyword automatically with dynamic mapping.<br>
Since we are using a term level query, we want to create a keyword mapping because we are looking for exact values.
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "tags.keyword": [ "Soup", "Cake" ]
    }
  }
}
```
