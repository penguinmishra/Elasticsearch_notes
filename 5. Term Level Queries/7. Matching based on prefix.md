## Matching based on prefix

- `prefix` allows to search documents that contain a term within a given field that begins with the given prefix.
- Query is not limited to searching fields containing a single term but will also match documents that have many words within the field if any of the term begins with specified prefix.
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "prefix": {
      "tags.keyword": "Vege"
    }
  }
}
```
Since we are using `keyword` which is not analyzed, the cases would matter. For example, the below search won't fetch any results if there is no tags with term starting with `vege`:
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "prefix": {
      "tags.keyword": "vege"
    }
  }
}
```
