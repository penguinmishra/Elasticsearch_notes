# Creating an index:

Simply execute the below script:

```
PUT /products
```

OR if you want to specify the number of replicas and shards, you might want to run:

```
PUT /products
{
	"settings":{
		"number_of_replicas":2,
		"number_of_shards":2
	}
}
```

At the cluster level, if `action.auto_create_index` is enabled, indices will automatically be created when adding documents. This is default `true`.
