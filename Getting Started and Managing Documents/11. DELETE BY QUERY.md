# DELETE BY QUERY

delete by query uses <code>delete_by_query</code> API to perform multiple deletes in single query:
```sh
POST /documents/delete_by_query{
	"query": {
		"match_all":{}
	}
}
```
it uses batch, PT and SN etc in the same way as <code>update_by_query</code>. Basically everything. You may include <code>"conflicts":"ignore"</code> if you wish to avoid version conflict.
