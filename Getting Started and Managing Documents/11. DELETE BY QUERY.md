# DELETE BY QUERY

delete by query uses `delete_by_query` API to perform multiple deletes in single query:
```
POST /documents/delete_by_query{
	"query": {
		"match_all":{}
	}
}
```
it uses batch, PT and SN etc in the same way as `update_by_query`. Basically everything. You may include `"conflicts":"ignore"` if you wish to avoid version conflict.
