# PRIMARY TERMS & SEQUENCE NUMBER

#### Primary Term:
- way to distinguish between old and new primary shards if primary shard has changed.
- essentially, a counter for how many times the primary shard has changed.
- primary term is appended to write operations.
- primary terms for all replication groups are persisted in cluster state.
- this enables replica shards to tell if the primary shard has changed since the operation was forwarded.

#### Sequence Number:
Apart from associating each operation with a primary term, a sequence number is also given to the operation.

- this sequence number is just incrementing counter for each operation at least until primary shard changes.
- primary shard is responsible for increasing this number when it processes a write request.
- sequence number help ES to know the order operation happened on a given primary shard.


- primary term & sequence number help ES to recover when primary shard changes.
- instead of comparing data on disk, it can use primary term & sequence number to figure out which operations have already been performed & which are needed to bring a shard upto date.
- for large indices, this process is expensive and not feasible to compare millions of operations to figure this out.
- especially when data is queried and updated at a high rate.

To speed up process, ES uses **checkpoints**- global and locally.
