# Querying Child Documents by Parent

- Fetching child documents using parent document's id might not always be enough.
- Cases are, you don't know parent document id or you want to search child documents based on some search criteria for parent document.
- Here, `has_parent` query type comes to our rescue:
```
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_parent": {
      "parent_type": "department",
      "query": {
        "term": {
          "name.keyword": "Development"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- You specify a query inside `has_parent` query like any other query.
- `parent_type` should have the relation name of parent which is `department` in our case.

The query gives the below result:
```
{
  "took" : 73,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 4,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "department",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "3",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_routing" : "1",
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Bo Andersen",
          "age" : 28,
          "gender" : "M",
          "join_fields" : {
            "name" : "employee",
            "parent" : 1
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "department",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "5",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_routing" : "1",
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "James Evans",
          "age" : 32,
          "gender" : "M",
          "join_fields" : {
            "name" : "employee",
            "parent" : 1
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "department",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "6",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_routing" : "1",
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Daniel Harris",
          "age" : 52,
          "gender" : "M",
          "join_fields" : {
            "name" : "employee",
            "parent" : 1
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "department",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "8",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_routing" : "1",
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Christina Parker",
          "age" : 29,
          "gender" : "F",
          "join_fields" : {
            "name" : "employee",
            "parent" : 1
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
If you notice, the child documents' `_score` has values as 1. That's because `has_parent` does not take parent query relevance score into account and adds 1 as score for child documnents. This can be overridden by specifying `"score" : true` in the `has_parent` query type:
```
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_parent": {
      "score": true,
      "parent_type": "department",
      "query": {
        "term": {
          "name.keyword": "Development"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Which then gives `_score` value as:
```
[TRUNCATED]
"hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 4,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.7917595,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "department",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "3",
        "_score" : 1.7917595,
        "_routing" : "1",
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Bo Andersen",
          "age" : 28,
          "gender" : "M",
          "join_fields" : {
            "name" : "employee",
            "parent" : 1
          }
        }
		[TRUNCATED]
```
Now, we see that the relevance score of the parent document has been added to the default 1.<br><br>
Relevance becomes important when a `match` query or some other query is used where we need the relevance of the parent document to be taken in account.<br><br>
If you need control on how child documents are sorted, you can do that using `function_score` [query][query] which is an advance type of query and rarely used.
<br><br>
`has_parent` is more flexible than `parent_id` query type!
