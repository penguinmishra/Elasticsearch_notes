Creating parent index first:
```
PUT /department
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "join_fields": {
        "type": "join",
        "relations" :{
          "department" : "employee"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Adding documents to parent index first:
```
PUT /department/_doc/1
{
  "name" : "Development",
  "join_fields" : "department"
}

PUT /department/_doc/2
{
  "name" : "Marketing",
  "join_fields" : "department"
}
```
This could be done this way as well:
```
PUT /department/_doc/1
{
  "name" : "Marketing",
  "join_fields" : {
    "name" : "department"
  }
}
```
