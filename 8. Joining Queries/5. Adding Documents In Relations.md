# Adding Documents In Relations

Creating parent index first:
```
PUT /department
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "join_fields": {
        "type": "join",
        "relations" :{
          "department" : "employee"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Adding documents to parent index first:
```
PUT /department/_doc/1
{
  "name" : "Development",
  "join_fields" : "department"
}

PUT /department/_doc/2
{
  "name" : "Marketing",
  "join_fields" : "department"
}
```
This could be done this way as well:
```
PUT /department/_doc/1
{
  "name" : "Marketing",
  "join_fields" : {
    "name" : "department"
  }
}
```
Now we have some documents in our index. Let's add some child objects.
This can be done by using `join_fields` which we specified in our parent index. In this object we need to specify the name of the key value mapping value (not index) which tells the ES that the document is an employee:
```
PUT /department/_doc/3
{
  "name": "Bo Andersen",
  "age": 28,
  "gender": "M",
  "join_fields" : {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "error": {
    "root_cause": [
      {
        "type": "mapper_parsing_exception",
        "reason": "failed to parse"
      }
    ],
    "type": "mapper_parsing_exception",
    "reason": "failed to parse",
    "caused_by": {
      "type": "illegal_argument_exception",
      "reason": "[routing] is missing for join field [join_fields]"
    }
  },
  "status": 400
}
```
* routing is finding a shard to store or fetch a document. Default behaviour is to use document's id as routing value and feed that into a hashing function*

- We need to add a query parameter to the query with a value matching the id of parent document.
- Reason : Parent and child document must be stored under the same shard and this is ensured by parent's document id. Since we did not specify the parent document id in child, we got the issue.
```
PUT /department/_doc/3?routing=1
{
  "name": "Bo Andersen",
  "age": 28,
  "gender": "M",
  "join_fields" : {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```
This succeeds:
```
{
  "_index" : "department",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "3",
  "_version" : 1,
  "result" : "created",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 2,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 4,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
```
