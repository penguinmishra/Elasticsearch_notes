# Terms lookup mechanism

Basic terms query looks up documents that contain one or more terms that we specify in the query. But sometimes, we might need to look up so many terms which is not feasible to include them in query explicitly. For that reason, the term query supports something called terms look up mechanism.<br><br>
What this lets us do is to specify an index type or an identifier of a document from which we want to retrieve terms. We also need to specify the paths to those terms.

*first, adding test data:*<br><br>

```
PUT /users/_doc/1
{
  "name" : "John Roberts",
  "following": [2,3]
}

PUT /users/_doc/2
{
  "name": "Elizabeth Ross",
  "following": []
}

PUT /users/_doc/3
{
  "name": "Jeremy Brooks",
  "following":[1,2]
}

PUT /users/_doc/4
{
  "name": "Dianna Moore",
  "following": [3,1]
}

PUT /stories/_doc/1
{
  "user": 3,
  "content": "Wow look, a penguin!"
}

PUT /stories/_doc/2
{
  "user": 1,
  "content": "Just another day at the office...#coffee"
}

PUT /stories/_doc/3
{
  "user": 1,
  "content": "Making search great again! #elasticsearch #elk"
}

PUT /stories/_doc/4
{
  "user": 4,
  "content": "Had a blast today! #rollercoaster #amusementpark"
}

PUT /stories/_doc/5
{
  "user": 4,
  "content": "Yay, I just got hired as an Elasticsearch consultant - so excited!"
}

PUT /stories/_doc/6
{
  "user": 2,
  "content": "Chilling at the beach @ Greece #vacation #goodtimes"
}
```

If we want to display the stories for a given user which will be the stories of users he or she is following, we need to search for stories published by the user IDs that the user is following.<br><br>

This can be done with the following query:
```
GET /stories/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "user": {
        "index": "users",
        "id":1,
        "path": "following"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
which gives the stories by users 2,3 who the user with id 1 is following:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "stories",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "user" : 3,
          "content" : "Wow look, a penguin!"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "stories",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "6",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "user" : 2,
          "content" : "Chilling at the beach @ Greece #vacation #goodtimes"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
If the `following` had ids nested inside it, we would have to specify `path` as follows:
`following.id`.

![terms_look_up][terms_look_up]

<br><br>

![terms_look_up_bts][terms_look_up_bts]

<br><br>

So, at the application level if we did this, there would have been too queries which would contribute to the latency:

![latency][latency]

<br><br>

- network latency and more data transfer.
- If user transferred thousands of users and if we used not integers but UUIDs.
- Better let ES do it internally.
- more the terms, slower the query.
- performance may be affected with more terms.
- terms are limited to 65K for a cluster which could be configured to per index as well.
