# Mapping Document Relationships

This can be done as following:
```
PUT /department
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "join_field": { 
        "type": "join",
        "relations": {
          "department": "employee"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- `join_field` is any name which can be given.
- `join` is special data type dedicated for defining relationships.
- `relations` has relations between documents.  The value could be an array as well. Since in our case, we have only one child.
- `department` and `employee` are arbitrary strings and could be anything and they need not match the names of indices.
