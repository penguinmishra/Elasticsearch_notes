# Join Limitations

- Documents that we are joining must be stored on the same index.
- Parent and child documents must be on the same shard.
- Only one join field per index. But a join field can have as many relations as you want.
- New relations can be added after creating the index.
- Child relations can only be added to existing parents.
- A document can only have one parent.
