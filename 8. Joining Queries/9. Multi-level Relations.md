# Multi-level Relations

We have been working only on one level. But we can have multi-level relationship. Something like this:<br>
![multi-level][multi-level]

```
PUT /company
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "join_field" :{
        "type": "join",
        "relations" :{
          "company" : ["department", "supplier"],
          "department": "employee"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now on to adding some documents:
```
PUT /company/_doc/1
{
  "name" : "My Company Inc.",
  "join_field" : "company"
}

PUT /company/_doc/2?routing=1
{
  "name": "Development",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "department",
    "parent":1
  }
}
```
And finally an employee. At this level, the shard should be same so the routing will be id of the company document and parent will be the id of the department:
```
PUT /company/_doc/3?routing=1
{
  "name": "Bo Anderson",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 2
  }
}
```
Added some more documents:
```
PUT /company/_doc/4
{
  "name": "Another Company, Inc.",
  "join_field": "company"
}

PUT /company/_doc/5?routing=4
{
  "name": "Marketing",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "department",
    "parent": 4
  }
}

PUT /company/_doc/6?routing=4
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 5
  }
}
```
![multi-level_relations][multi-level_relations]
## For searching:
It's simple and similar to how it was done earlier but now it's just one additional level.<br><br>
In multi-level relations, we would use `has_child`, `has_parent` and `parent_id`. There is no change as such.<br><br>
Suppose we want to search  companies that have  persons named John Doe, then we would search for departments that have employees named John Doe. Basically, we want to search companies containing at least one department which has an employee name John Doe:
```
GET /company/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "department",
      "query": {
        "has_child": {
          "type": "employee",
          "query": {
            "term": {
              "name.keyword": "John Doe"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "took" : 167,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "company",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "4",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Another Company, Inc.",
          "join_field" : "company"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
The first `has_child` searches for departments which matches the second inner `has_child` query. In this case, it is an employee named John Doe.<br><br>
If we want to search for companies where Bo Anderson works, we would simply replace John Doe with Bo Anderson. If we provide any other name, there won't be any documents.
