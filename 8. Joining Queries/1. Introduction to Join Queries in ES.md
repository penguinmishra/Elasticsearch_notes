# Introduction to Join Queries in ES

RDBMS is all about relations between tables:
![RDBMS][RDBMS] <br>
normalized. in ES, data is always denormalized. That leads to best performance.<br>
This might be a disc space problem when we are delaing with denormalized data. But then again, we should not use ES as our primary data store. <br>
ES philosophy: performance > disc storage <br>
ES does not support joins like those in RDBMS, but supports simple joins. Though joins are expensive and inefficient.
