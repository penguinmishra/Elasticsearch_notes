# Querying Parent By Child Documents

We can retrieve parent documents based on a query using on child document. This is done by `has_child` query (searching for departments that have employees with age greater than or equal to 50 and boost the score if they are male.):
```
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "employee",
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "range": {
                "age": {
                  "gte": 50
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "should": [
            {
              "term": {
                "gender.keyword": "M"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "department",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Development",
          "join_fields" : "department"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
One department matches because it has an employee of an age of 52.
Two points:
1. we can include the relevance score of matching child documents in the result. That is done not by `"score": true` like in `has_parent` query but with `"score_mode"` which can have values of `min, max, sum, avg` and `none`. `none` is default behaviour.<br>
![score_mode][score_mode]
<br>
The query would look something like this:
```
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "employee",
      "score_mode": "sum", 
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "range": {
                "age": {
                  "gte": 50
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "should": [
            {
              "term": {
                "gender.keyword": "M"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This is helpful when you want to know how well a child document match the given criteria.
2. `has_child` also allows us to specify the minimum and maximum number of child documents which should match the criteria. This can be done using `min_children` and `max_children`:
```
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "employee",
      "score_mode": "sum", 
      "min_children": 2,
      "max_children": 5, 
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "range": {
                "age": {
                  "gte": 50
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "should": [
            {
              "term": {
                "gender.keyword": "M"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 0,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  }
}
```
This did not give any results because we have set the minimum number of child documents as 2 whereas available is only 1.

The sorting is supported in this similar to the `has_parent` query. This can be found [here][sorting_child]
