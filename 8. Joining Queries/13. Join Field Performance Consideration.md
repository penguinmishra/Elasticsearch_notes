# Join Field Performance Consideration

*Join Queries are expensive*
<br><br>

- the more child documents pointing to unique parents, the slower the `has_child` query is.
- More the documents, the slower the performance. Query time becomes more. Though you might not notice this before it's a problem.
- The number of parent documents slows down the `has_parent` query.
- In case of multilevel relations, each level of document relations adds an overhead to queries.
- In some scenarios, the performance of join fields won't be bad. Such as if you don't have lots of documents and won't have it anytime soon, performance will be fine.
- Consider using nested data type.
- Generally joining fields should not be used.
