# Nested Inner Hits

- Used when we want to know which inner object caused a department to match.
- we do that using `inner_hits`. `inner_hits` can be used with the join datatype.
- when we use `inner_hits` in context of nested objects, we refer to the feature as nested inner hits.
- How we can instruct ES to include nested inner hits: by adding `inner_hits` to the query. That's it!
```
GET /department/_search
{ 
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "inner_hits": {}, 
      "path": "employees", 
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "match": {
                "employees.position": "intern"
              }  
            },
            {
              "term": {
                "employees.gender.keyword": {
                  "value": "F"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Which gives us:

Clearly this is a very long result which includes `hits` and `_source` at the `employee` document level also. We don't need that. We can eliminate that by specifying `_source` as `false` in our query:
```
GET /department/_search
{ 
  "_source": false, 
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "inner_hits": {}, 
      "path": "employees", 
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "match": {
                "employees.position": "intern"
              }  
            },
            {
              "term": {
                "employees.gender.keyword": {
                  "value": "F"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Now this gives us:

Which is concise and easy to read. It gives us `hits` only for `employees` which we inteded to have. It gives us `inner_hits` which gives us the relevant documents! Source documents for `department` are not returned.
If you don't add `"_source" : false`, you would of course have access to the department documents as before.<br><br>
Notice that we have in `hits` a `nested` keyword which tells us which nested object the hit came from. In our case it is equal to the path that we define. Because we are searching for only one type of nested query, but that might not be the case for more complex queries.<br>

- By default, inner hits are sorted by their relevance scores. But if you need to change it, you can do that by specifying `sort` inside the `inner_hits` object. But that this might not be that frequent.
- `inner_hits` support some features such as highlighting, source filtering, script field and the explain API. The explain API can be used to understand why a given hit matched and why it was scored the way it is.
