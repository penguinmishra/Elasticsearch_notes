# Querying by Parent ID

This can be done by using `parent_id` query type:
```
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "parent_id": {
      "type": "employee",
      "id" : 1
    }
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
[TRUNCATED]
 "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "department",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "3",
        "_score" : 0.49247646,
        "_routing" : "1",
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Bo Andersen",
          "age" : 28,
          "gender" : "M",
          "join_fields" : {
            "name" : "employee",
            "parent" : 1
          }
        }
      },
	 [TRUNCATED]
```
- `hits` contains `join_fields` under the `_source` key. To check the type for relevance.
- `hits` also includes a `_routing` key which has the value of the id of the parent document. Parent and children must be placed on the same shard.
- while using `parent_id` query, the `id` value is by default used as the routing value and figure out the shard. This can be overridden using `routing` parameter if custom routing is used.
