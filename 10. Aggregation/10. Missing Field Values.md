# Missing Field Values

- If we are using a field for aggregation and if that field is not present for some of the documents or have null value, then we can use `missing` aggregation for that.
- Since the `missing` aggregation is bucket aggregation, it creates a bucket with the orders that either don't have a status field at all or have the value as `null`.

Adding documents:
```
POST /order/_doc/100
{
  "total_amount": 100
}

POST /order/_doc/1002
{
  "total_amount": 200,
  "status": null
}
```
Running `missing` aggregation:
```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_missing_agg": {
      "missing": {
        "field": "status.keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "took" : 50,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1001,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "my_missing_agg" : {
      "doc_count" : 2
    }
  }
}
```

- This is evident from the result that the `doc_count` is 2 which means that there are 2 documents which either do not have a status value or have the value as `null`.
- It respects the `null_value` parameter if you use that in the mapping.
- The `missing` aggregation is used in combination with other aggregations. For example, `sum` metric aggregation can be used to get the total of order amount for the orders which do not have the `status` value or have it as `null`:
```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_missing_agg": {
      "missing": {
        "field": "status.keyword"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "missing_status_orders": {
          "sum": {
            "field": "total_amount"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1001,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "my_missing_agg" : {
      "doc_count" : 2,
      "missing_status_orders" : {
        "value" : 300.0
      }
    }
  }
}
```
We can see that the order total comes to be 300 which is correct because we have 2 orders where status is not there or is `null`.
