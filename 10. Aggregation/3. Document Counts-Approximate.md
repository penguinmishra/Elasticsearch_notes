# Document Counts-Approximate

- The counts are not accurate because of the distributed nature of the ES cluster.
- An index is distributed across multiple shards by default.
- In search, the coordinating node prompts each shard to provide top unique terms. E.g. If we search for top 3, coordinating shard asks each shard to provide top 3 terms.
- After receiving data from shards, coordinating shard computes the final result. This is where the counts may be inaccurate.

When asked by coordinating shard, each shard returns their top 3 as highlighted in above image and send the data to coordinating shard. Then the coordinating shard sorts them and what is final result by coordinating shard is in Actual Result column:

However, as we see that the correct results take into account the count of the rest of the products as well. But since shard sent their top 3, it didn't happen. B and F's counts are wrong actually.<br>
This becomes a problem when the `size` parameter is set to a lower number. But higher `size` value increases high volume of data. So, it's a trade-off between accuracy and performance. Default size though is 10.<br>
this happens because all of the documents are not on a single shard. Had it been the case, there won't have been any problem.<br>

# `doc_count_error_upper_bound`

Suppose we have the below query in which a request is made to obtain the top 5 terms in the field product, ordered by descending document count from an index with 3 shards. In this case each shard is asked to give its top 5 terms.
```
GET /_search
{
    "aggs" : {
        "products" : {
            "terms" : {
                "field" : "product",
                "size" : 5
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The terms for each of the three shards are shown below with their respective document counts in brackets:

Sr. No. | Shard A | Shard B | Shard C
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Product A (25) | Product A (30) | Product A (45)
2 | Product B (18) | Product B (25) | Product C (44)
3 | Product C (6) | Product F (17) | Product Z (36)
4 | Product D (3) | Product Z (16) | Product G (30)
5 | Product E (2) | Product G (15) | Product E (29)
6 | Product F (2) | Product H (14) | Product H (28)
7 | Product G (2) | Product I (10) | Product Q (2)
8 | Product H (2) | Product Q (6) | Product D (1)
9 | Product I (1) | Product J (6) | 
10 | Product J (1) | Product C (4) | 

The shards will return their top 5 terms so the results from the shards will be:

 Sr No.| Shard A | Shard B | Shard C
 --- | --- | --- | ---
 1 | Product A (25) | Product A (30) | Product A (45)
 2 | Product B (18) | Product B (25) | Product C (44)
 3 | Product C (6) | Product F (17) | Product Z (36)
 4 | Product D (3) | Product Z (16) | Product G (30)
 5 | Product E (2) | Product G (15) | Product E (29)
