# Filtering Out Documents

- Instead of query context, in some cases filter context can be used. Similar to a query so it could be a term query/match query. This filter takes place of any of `terms` aggregation or `stats` aggregation:
```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_own_filter": {
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "total_amount": {
            "lt": 50
          }
        }
      },
      "aggs": {
        "average_custom": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "total_amount"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Avg aggregation runs within the context of the filter. It only aggregates documents that match the range query. So range query is top level aggregation. Meaning, it runs in the context of the query which is an implicit `match_all` query. And average aggregation runs in the context of filter aggregation. Meaning some documents have been filtered out so that the bucket that the avg aggregation works upon does not have any orders less than 50.

The above query gives:

```
{
  "took" : 209,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1000,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "my_own_filter" : {
      "doc_count" : 164,
      "average_custom" : {
        "value" : 32.59371952894257
      }
    }
  }
}
```
