# Global Aggregation

- `global` aggregation is to break out of the aggregation context.
- even if we have included a query which narrows down a set of documents that an aggregation would normally use, we can get access to all the documents as if the query wasn't even there.
- gives a way to access all the documents and not only to the ones provided by the query.
- can add sub-aggregation to this.

```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "total_amount": {
        "gte": 100
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "my_global_agg": {
      "global": {},
      "aggs": {
        "my_global_inner_agg": {
          "stats": {
            "field": "total_amount"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 16,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 489,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "my_global_agg" : {
      "doc_count" : 1000,
      "my_global_inner_agg" : {
        "count" : 1000,
        "min" : 10.270000457763672,
        "max" : 281.7699890136719,
        "avg" : 109.20960997009277,
        "sum" : 109209.60997009277
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- note that the `doc_count` and `value` under `hits` are different which shows that the global aggregation works on all the documents. This is because the `global` does not use the query context. In a way, implicit `match_all` query is used.
- Adding another aggregation other than global would run in the query context:
```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "total_amount": {
        "gte": 100
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "my_global_agg": {
      "global": {},
      "aggs": {
        "my_global_inner_agg": {
          "stats": {
            "field": "total_amount"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "my_normal_agg": {
      "stats": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 489,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "my_normal_agg" : {
      "count" : 489,
      "min" : 100.05000305175781,
      "max" : 281.7699890136719,
      "avg" : 157.32703472987762,
      "sum" : 76932.91998291016
    },
    "my_global_agg" : {
      "doc_count" : 1000,
      "my_global_inner_agg" : {
        "count" : 1000,
        "min" : 10.270000457763672,
        "max" : 281.7699890136719,
        "avg" : 109.20960997009277,
        "sum" : 109209.60997009277
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Evidently, the `count` values show that the `my_global_inner_agg` ran in `match_all` context while `my_normal_agg` ran in the query context which was specified.
- **NOTE** :
