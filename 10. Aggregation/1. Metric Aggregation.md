# Metric Aggregation

- Single Value Numeric Metric Aggregation
- Multi Value Numeric Metric Aggregation

#### Sum, Avg, Min, Max, Stats Aggregation
```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "arbitrary_name_sum": {
      "sum": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- `"size": 0` because we are interested in the aggregation and not the result of the query.
- `arbitrary_name_sum` could be any name that is to be given to the aggregation. This is the name that will show up in the result.
- `sum` is the name of the aggregation type.

The above query produces:
```
{
  "took" : 20,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1000,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "arbitrary_name_sum" : {
      "value" : 109209.60997009277
    }
  }
}
```
We can add more aggregations in the same query which would yield more values:
```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "arbitrary_name_sum": {
      "sum": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    },
    "arbitrary_num_avg": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    },
    "arbitrary_num_min": {
      "min": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    },
    "arbitrary_num_max": {
      "max": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
this yields:
```
{
  "took" : 85,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1000,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "arbitrary_name_sum" : {
      "value" : 109209.60997009277
    },
    "arbitrary_num_min" : {
      "value" : 10.270000457763672
    },
    "arbitrary_num_avg" : {
      "value" : 109.20960997009277
    },
    "arbitrary_num_max" : {
      "value" : 281.7699890136719
    }
  }
}
```

there is a separate aggregation which could provide the same result, namely `stats`:
```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "arbitrary_agg_stat": {
      "stats": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1000,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "arbitrary_agg_stat" : {
      "count" : 1000,
      "min" : 10.270000457763672,
      "max" : 281.7699890136719,
      "avg" : 109.20960997009277,
      "sum" : 109209.60997009277
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cardinality aggregation

- counts the distinct values for the field.

```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "arbitrary_cardinality_name_number_of_distinct_salesmen": {
      "cardinality": {
        "field": "salesman.id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1000,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "arbitrary_cardinality_name_number_of_distinct_salesmen" : {
      "value" : 100
    }
  }
}
```
We can see that there are 100 unique salesmen ids.
- cardinality aggregation produces the approximate numbers. Producing exact numbers would take up too many resources of the cluster. An algorithm try-and-yield is used by ES for this. Generally in ES the numbers are precise.


## `value_count` aggregation

- counts the number of values that the aggregation is based on.
- since we have 1000 documents, we should expect that this aggregation gives use 1000:
```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "arbitrary_value_count_name": {
      "value_count": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1000,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "arbitrary_value_count_name" : {
      "value" : 1000
    }
  }
}
```
We see that arbitrary_value_count_name has 1000. So it works. Useful in conjuction with other aggregations. For example in `avg`, we can check how many values were considered to produce the average.
