# Aggregating Nested Objects

If we want to find out any aggregation from a nested object, then we might think of doing something like this:
```
GET /department/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_not_working_agg": {
      "min": {
        "field": "employees.age"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Since employee is a nested object, the above aggregation won't work and the results would be:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 8,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "my_not_working_agg" : {
      "value" : null
    }
  }
}
```

To get aggregation from a nested object, we need to write a nested aggregation:
```
GET /department/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_nested_agg": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "employees"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Now the above aggregation is a basic one and further more aggregations can be added to it:
```
GET /department/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "employees": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "employees"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "minimum_age": {
          "min": {
            "field": "employees.age"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
} 
```

## I need more clarity on above query.
