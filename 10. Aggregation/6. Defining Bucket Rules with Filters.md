# Defining Bucket Rules with Filters

- We'll see a `filters` aggregation which is kind of related to `filter` aggregation.
- Defines rules for which buckets documents should be placed into.
- Done by specifying bucket names in query clauses that documents must match to be placed in the bucket.
- So we could specify a bucket with a name of shirt and define that only products whose names contain term shirt should be placed within that bucket.
- We'll create 2 buckets from recipe index- one for pasta recipes and another for spaghetti recipes:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_own_filters": {
      "filters": {
        "filters": {
          "pasta_bucket_rule_and_name": {
            "match": {
              "title":"pasta"
            }
          },
          "spaghetti_bucket_rule_and_name": {
            "match":{
              "title":"spaghetti"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Here we see that there is a `filters` parameters which has another `filters`. This is so so that we could add parameters to the `filters` aggregation so you just have to define filters within the `filters` parameter nested within `filters` aggregation.
- `filters` parameter (inner one) would hold the bucket rules which would be usually a query clause. These bucket rules are given own names which are the names for filters as well.
The above query gives:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 21,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "my_own_filters" : {
      "buckets" : {
        "pasta_bucket_rule_and_name" : {
          "doc_count" : 9
        },
        "spaghetti_bucket_rule_and_name" : {
          "doc_count" : 4
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- This gives us only `doc_count` which tells us the number of documents which fall in that bucket. We could do more with the `filters` by adding aggregations. Such as adding `avg` aggregation:

```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_own_filters": {
      "filters": {
        "filters": {
          "pasta_bucket_rule_and_name": {
            "match": {
              "title":"pasta"
            }
          },
          "spaghetti_bucket_rule_and_name": {
            "match":{
              "title":"spaghetti"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "aggs": {
        "my_aggs": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "ratings"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Which gives us:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 21,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    "my_own_filters" : {
      "buckets" : {
        "pasta_bucket_rule_and_name" : {
          "doc_count" : 9,
          "my_aggs" : {
            "value" : 3.4125
          }
        },
        "spaghetti_bucket_rule_and_name" : {
          "doc_count" : 4,
          "my_aggs" : {
            "value" : 2.3684210526315788
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Now we can see that for every bucket, we also get the average ratings for each bucket.
