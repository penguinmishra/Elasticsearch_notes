# Histograms

- histogram dynamiccally builds buckets from numeric values based on a specific interval.
- ES builds buckets for each step of interval between minimum and maximum value for the field.
- Say we have 0-100 (min and max for field) and interval we give 25. Then ES creates buckets for each step (1st step0, 2nd 25, 3rd 50, 4th 75 and 5th 100).
- For an order with field value of 60, bucket will be rounded off to the closest bucket i.e. 50 and will be put into that bucket.
- In case max value of the field is 281, and last bucket is 275, 281 will be rounded off to 275 and will be put in that bucket.

Example:
```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_histo_agg": {
      "histogram": {
        "field": "total_amount",
        "interval": 25
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This gives us:

```
[TRUNCATED]
"aggregations" : {
    "my_histo_agg" : {
      "buckets" : [
        {
          "key" : 0.0,
          "doc_count" : 42
        },
        {
          "key" : 25.0,
          "doc_count" : 122
        },
        {
          "key" : 50.0,
          "doc_count" : 153
        },
        {
          "key" : 75.0,
          "doc_count" : 194
        },
        {
          "key" : 100.0,
          "doc_count" : 124
        },
        {
          "key" : 125.0,
          "doc_count" : 125
        },
        {
          "key" : 150.0,
          "doc_count" : 89
        },
        {
          "key" : 175.0,
          "doc_count" : 71
        },
        {
          "key" : 200.0,
          "doc_count" : 42
        },
        {
          "key" : 225.0,
          "doc_count" : 33
        },
        {
          "key" : 250.0,
          "doc_count" : 4
        },
        {
          "key" : 275.0,
          "doc_count" : 1
        }
      ]
[TRUNCATED]
```

- if there are no documents which fall in a bucket, you might see an empty bucket (If you do not specify `min_doc_count` value greater than 0). Since we do not have any bucket where documents would be absent, we do not see such a bucket.
- `min_doc_count` indicates how many documents must fall into a bucket for it to be included in the results. Setting the value to 1 means that there won't be any empty bucket:

```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_histo_agg": {
      "histogram": {
        "field": "total_amount",
        "interval": 25,
        "min_doc_count": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- If we provide a query which provides a range not starting from 0, then histogram aggregation does not have any idea of any document which fall in buckets starting from 0 to the specified range. Because aggregation now would run in the query context:

```
GET /order/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "total_amount": {
        "gte": 100
      }
    }
  }, 
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_histo_agg": {
      "histogram": {
        "field": "total_amount",
        "interval": 25,
        "min_doc_count": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Gives:
```
[TRUNCATED]
"aggregations" : {
    "my_histo_agg" : {
      "buckets" : [
        {
          "key" : 100.0,
          "doc_count" : 124
        },
        {
          "key" : 125.0,
          "doc_count" : 125
        },
        {
          "key" : 150.0,
          "doc_count" : 89
        },
        {
          "key" : 175.0,
          "doc_count" : 71
        },
        {
          "key" : 200.0,
          "doc_count" : 42
        },
        {
          "key" : 225.0,
          "doc_count" : 33
        },
        {
          "key" : 250.0,
          "doc_count" : 4
        },
        {
          "key" : 275.0,
          "doc_count" : 1
        }
      ]
    }

```
- But what if you still want buckets below 100 to be part of the results even if they contain no documents or perhaps you don't know if the buckets will contain any documents based on the aggregation context because you don't know which documents are matched ahead of time.
- To force buckets to be present within two boundaries, you can do that by using `extended_bounds` object which contains `min` and `max` keys. This will create buckets for min and max bounds even if there are no documents for this range:

```
GET /order/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "total_amount": {
        "gte": 100
      }
    }
  }, 
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_histo_agg": {
      "histogram": {
        "field": "total_amount",
        "interval": 25,
        "extended_bounds": {
          "min": 0,
          "max": 500
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Which gives:

```
[TRUNCATED]
"aggregations" : {
    "my_histo_agg" : {
      "buckets" : [
        {
          "key" : 0.0,
          "doc_count" : 0
        },
        {
          "key" : 25.0,
          "doc_count" : 0
        },
.
.
.
{
          "key" : 450.0,
          "doc_count" : 0
        },
        {
          "key" : 475.0,
          "doc_count" : 0
        },
        {
          "key" : 500.0,
          "doc_count" : 0
        }
      ]
[TRUNCATED]
```

- Since aggregation runs in query context, the query does not give any document to range specified if that range falls out of the query range. But buckets will still appear and will have `doc_count` set to 0. (if you have your aggregation `min_doc_count` set to greater than 0, you would not see your bucket in the result).
- Similar to the `histogram`, we have `date_histogram` aggregation which does the same thing but for date. Difference is of use of a an expression for the `interval` parameter which can be `year, quarter, month, week, day, hour, minute, second`:

```
GET /order/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "my_date_histo": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "purchased_at",
        "interval": "month"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

which gives:
```
[TRUNCATED]
"aggregations" : {
    "my_date_histo" : {
      "buckets" : [
        {
          "key_as_string" : "2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
          "key" : 1451606400000,
          "doc_count" : 78
        },
        {
          "key_as_string" : "2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z",
          "key" : 1454284800000,
          "doc_count" : 72
        },
[TRUNCATED]
```

- `keyed`, `key` and `format` parameters can be used in this
- both `histogram` and `date_histogram` support an offset parameter which is useful if you want to add or subtract from each bucket key. For `histogram`, we need to specify a number and for `date_histogram` we need to specify a date map expression such as 1d.
