## Debugging unexpected search results

To figure out what went wrong or what happened BTS while searching in ES, `_explain` API is used:
```
GET /products/_explain/1
{
  "query": {
    "match":{
      "name": "lobster"
    }
  }
}
```
Here, we are using `_explain` API to search for document with id 1 and match is against name lobster.
This gives:
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "1",
  "matched" : false,
  "explanation" : {
    "value" : 0.0,
    "description" : "no matching term",
    "details" : [ ]
  }
}
```
Which provides details on why our query didn't fetch any results.
