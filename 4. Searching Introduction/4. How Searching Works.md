## How Searching Works

1. Inside cluster when it receives an HTTP request, it goes to a node which then acts as a coordinating node (responsible for sending queries to other ndoes, assembling results and sending them back to client).
2. By default, any node in cluster may act as a coordinating node and may receive HTTP request.
3. First, this node will perform the query itself since it consists shard which should be searched.
4. This may not be the case always but since we have only one index, this will always be the case.
5. Coordinate node broadcasts the request to every other shard in the index which may go to either a primary or replica shard.
6. However, coordinating node decides which node to send the request to.
7. When other shards (could be primary or replica) respond with their results, the coordinating shard merges the results, sorts them and returns them to the client.
8. Approach is different if you retrieve a document by its id.
9. In that case, the request is routed to the appropriate shard instead of being broadcasted to all of the index shards.
