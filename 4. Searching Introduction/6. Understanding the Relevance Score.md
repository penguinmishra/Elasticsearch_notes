## Understanding the Relevance Score (`_score`)
ES does this and provides data on how well a document matches which is usually absent in RDBMS.  
Before calculating relevance of matches, ES will determine if document matches the query using boolean model. This is to avoid having to compute relevant scores for document that won't be part of the results anyway.  
The reelvant score is represented by `_score` which holds a floating point value.  

#### How ES calculates

- depends on the type of search query.
- algorithms can be changed by the user.
- uptil recently, ES used to use TF/IDF (Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency) algorithms
- now Okapi BM25 is used which shares many similarities with the older one.

#### Factors used to calculate `_score`

**TF**:
- how many times does the term appear in the field for a given document?
- more times of appearance - more relevance at least for that term.
- example: if _salad_ is twice in a field and we search _salad_ term, this makes it more relevant than if the term was there only once or not at all.
