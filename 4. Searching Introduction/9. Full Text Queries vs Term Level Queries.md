## Full Text Queries vs Term Level Queries

Executing the below queries:
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term":{
      "name": "lobster"
    }
  }
}

GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term":{
      "name": "Lobster"
    }
  }
}

GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match":{
      "name": "lobster"
    }
  }
}
```
gives<br>
5 records for first query with `"name" : "Lobster - Live",` in one of the records,<br>
0 records for the second one and<br>
5 records for third query with `"name" : "Lobster - Live",` in one of the records.<br>

# The Text fields are analyzed and term level queries are not analyzed. And this makes the difference.

- Since the text fields are analyzed, the terms are scored in inverted index with lower-case using lower-case filter.
- When we executed the first term query, `lobster` is in lowercase and it matches the inverted index and hence the search is successful.
- For the second query, the term query, `Lobster` is in uppercase and it does not match the inverted index and hence the search fails to yield any result.
- The third query, the match query is analyzed using the same analyzer which was used while indexing the document. hence even if we give `lobster` as `Lobster`, the analyzer kicks in (in this case the standard analyzer) and the search is successful in the inverted index.
