## Understanding Query Results
Let's take a simple search query REST request:
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
Which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 4,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 2,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1001,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "products",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "name" : "Wine - Maipo Valle Cabernet",
          "price" : 152,
          "in_stock" : 38,
          "sold" : 47,
          "tags" : [
            "Alcohol",
            "Wine"
          ],
          "description" : "Aliquam augue quam, sollicitudin vitae, consectetuer eget, rutrum at, lorem. Integer tincidunt ante vel ipsum. Praesent blandit lacinia erat. Vestibulum sed magna at nunc commodo placerat. Praesent blandit. Nam nulla. Integer pede justo, lacinia eget, tincidunt eget, tempus vel, pede. Morbi porttitor lorem id ligula.",
          "is_active" : true,
          "created" : "2004/05/13"
        }
		[TRUNCATED]
```
The above query result has been truncated on purpose.

### Query Results Tags

- `"took"` : Represents miliseconds that query took to execute.
- `"time_out"` : Whether or not the search request timed-out.
- `"_shards"` : Object has below tags:
	- `"total"` : number of shards that were searched.
	- `"successful"` : number of shards that completed the search successfully.
	- `"failed"` : number of shards that failed to search.
- `"hits"` : This is the main object that holds search data. It has below tags inside it:
	- `"total"` : total number of documents that matched the search criteria.
	- `"_hits"`: this is an array which contains matched documents. By default 10 documents are returned but that can be changed. This has `"_score"` tag:
		- `"_score"` : Each matching document has `_score` property- a number indicating on how well a document matched the search query.
	- `"max_score"` : contains the highest score for any of the matched documents. By default matches are sorted by their relevance. So this property contains the `_score` value of the first matched document.
