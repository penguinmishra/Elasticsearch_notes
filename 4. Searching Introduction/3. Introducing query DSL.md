## Introducing query DSL

In query DSL, specify the search query in the JSON object.<br>
Two types:
1. Leaf Query
2. Compound Query

![Leaf and Compound Queries][LeafCompound]

#### Leaf Query
basic form of query.

#### Compound Query
Could have leaf queries or compound queries inside and these are RECURSIVE in nature.

- Simplest form of Query DSL:
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
Here `match_all` is the name of the query type and the key. The value of the query definition would be specified as value.
