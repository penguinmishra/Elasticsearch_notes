# Adding another node to cluster in dev
If you want to run 2 nodes on same cluster, then you can create two copies of the same ES folder and run them separately with the same cluster.name property. ES is smart enough to switch to another port if default one is used. Same goes for communication port.
*IMPORTANT*: If you have already used a single ES folder to run ES and you want to run another node and you want to make a copy of the same ES folder to start another node, you should delete /data folder in ES folder which contains the node data in /node folder. Otherwise you shall get exceptions when the ES tries to join two nodes. The ids of the nodes would be same.
