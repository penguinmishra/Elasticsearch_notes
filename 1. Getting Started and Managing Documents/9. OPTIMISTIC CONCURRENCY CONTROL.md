# OPTIMISTIC CONCURRENCY CONTROL

- a way to prevent an old version of document overwriting a more recent version of it and hence risking the latest data loss. May happen when write operations arrive out of sequence.
- example: handling concurrent visitors for a web.
in ecommerce, in check-out, for a user app retrieves product from ES. and at the same time, another user also retrieves the product in another thread.
Now, both threads retrieved the same product. First thread subtracts in_stock value by 1 and updates the document and updates the product through ES API and second as well. This creates problems since the second thread thinks that it has the latest state of product. But it has been updated by 1 by 1st thread. If we allow that to happen, the in_stock should have value minus by 2 but has minus by 1 which is data corruption.

Ideally, update needs to fail if there is a mismatch in the version.

Old Way: checking version. This had some problems which Primary Term and Sequence Number addressed.
New Way: User PT (Primary Term) and SN (Sequence Number).

When app retrieves the product, the PT and SN are included in the results:
```
{
	...
	"_primary_term": 1,
	"_seq_no": 71
}
```
when updating, these numbers need to be sent:
```
POST /products/_update/100?if_primary_term=1&if_seq_no=71
```

ES will use these 2 values so that it does not overwrite the document if `document` was updated meanwhile. And operation will fail.
```
POST /products/_update/100?if_primary_term=1&if_seq_no=8
{
  "doc": {
    "in_stock": 43
  }
}
```
Yields:
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "100",
  "_version" : 10,
  "result" : "updated",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 3,
    "successful" : 2,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 15,
  "_primary_term" : 3
}
```
But running it again yields:
```
{
  "error": {
    "root_cause": [
      {
        "type": "version_conflict_engine_exception",
        "reason": "[100]: version conflict, required seqNo [8], primary term [1]. current document has seqNo [15] and primary term [3]",
        "index_uuid": "mqwOik8qQTuZPFvpchEJHw",
        "shard": "0",
        "index": "products"
      }
    ],
    "type": "version_conflict_engine_exception",
    "reason": "[100]: version conflict, required seqNo [8], primary term [1]. current document has seqNo [15] and primary term [3]",
    "index_uuid": "mqwOik8qQTuZPFvpchEJHw",
    "shard": "0",
    "index": "products"
  },
  "status": 409
}
```
Because the there has been change in either the `_primary_term` or `_seq_no`. The current state is:
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "100",
  "_version" : 10,
  "_seq_no" : 15,
  "_primary_term" : 3,
  "found" : true,
  "_source" : {
    "name" : "Toaster",
    "price" : 69,
    "in_stock" : 43,
    "tags" : [
      "electronics"
    ]
  }
}
```
The `_seq_no` has changed from 8 to 15 and `_primary_term` has changed from 1 to 3.

This issue needs to be handled at the application level. You should retrieve the document again and use new `_primary_term` and `_seq_no` and try updating.
