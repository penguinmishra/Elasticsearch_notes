# Updating documents:

ES documents are immutable. If we update it, it simply replaces it. This is how update API works:
1. The current `document` is retrieved
2. The filed values are changed
3. The existing `document` is replaced with the modified `document`.

Here is how update is done.
#### **NOTE**: This is the same way you can add a new field.

POST /products/_update/100
{
	"doc" :{
		"in_stock":3
	}
}

Generically:

```
POST /*index_name*/_update/*id*
{
	"doc" : {
		"*key*":*value*
	}
}
```
Running above gives:
```
{
  "_index" : "products",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "100",
  "_version" : 4,
  "result" : "updated",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 3,
    "successful" : 2,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 4,
  "_primary_term" : 2
}
```

#### Adding a new field:
```
POST /*index_name*/_update/*id*
{
	"doc" : {
		"*new key*":*new value*
	}
}
```
**IMPORTANT**: IF NEW VALUE IS SAME AS THE EXISTING VALUE, YOU WOULD GET "result" AS "noop" INSTEAD OF "updated".
HOWEVER, IN CASE OF SCRIPTED UPDATES, YOU WOULD GET "result" AS "updated" NO MATTER IF THE NEW VALUE IS SAME AS OLD ONE.
