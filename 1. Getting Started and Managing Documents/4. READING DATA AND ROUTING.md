# READING DATA AND ROUTING

#### Routing;
Routing is process of resolving a shard for a `document`.
Formula used when indexing, retrieving and updating documents:
`shard_num = hash(_routing) % num_of_primary_shards`

Routing can be customised. The default strategy for routing distributes documents evenly.
One of the reasons why and index's shards cannot be changed is that the routing formula would then yield different results.

#### READING DATA
The shard num for retrieval could be primary or replica shard for the reason that if all requests are directed to same shard, it does not scale well.

A shard is chosen from a replication group (which is combination of primary and replica shards) with **Adapter Replica Selection (ARS)** which selects shards copy that is esteemed to be best on basis of some metadata and which is believed to give best performance.
Once the shard is selected, the coordinating node sends the real request to that shard. When shard responds, coordinating shard receives it and shares it with the client/app/command line request/kibana.
