# Proximity Searches

- When searching for phrases, each term must appear exactly in that order for the `match_phrase` query to match. This is done when the analysis takes place. The analysis process stores the position of the term as well.
- If we want to relax our search, such as two terms should match but there could be one term between them, then we have to use `slop`.
First adding index and documents:
```
PUT /proximity/_doc/1
{
  "title": "Spicy Sauce"
}

PUT /proximity/_doc/2
{
  "title": "Spicy Tomato Sauce"
}

PUT /proximity/_doc/3
{
  "title": "Spicy Tomato and Garlic Sauce"
}

PUT /proximity/_doc/4
{
  "title": "Tomato Sauce (spicy)"
}

PUT /proximity/_doc/5
{
  "title": "Spicy and very delicious Tomato Sauce"
}
```
So, if we perform a search query like this:
```
GET /proximity/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": "spicy sauce"
    }
  }
}
```
We get:
```
{
  "took" : 139,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.21585016,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.21585016,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Spicy Sauce"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To use the `slop` parameter, we need to specify the allowable numbers of terms between the terms that we are looking for:
```
GET /proximity/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": {
        "query": "spicy sauce",
        "slop": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The above query gives:
```
{
  "took" : 71,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.21585016,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.21585016,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Spicy Sauce"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 0.12672736,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Spicy Tomato Sauce"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Which shows that the query matches phrase where there is one term between the terms used in phrased searched.<br>

So, if we specify `slop` as 2:
```
GET /proximity/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": {
        "query": "spicy sauce",
        "slop": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We get an interesting match:
```
{
  "took" : 2,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 3,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.21585016,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.21585016,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Spicy Sauce"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 0.12672736,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Spicy Tomato Sauce"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "4",
        "_score" : 0.094962806,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Tomato Sauce (spicy)"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The last match `tomato sauce (spicy)` also matched because it moved 2 places. As long as a term move does not exceed the slop parameter, we have a match:

- Terms may be moved around to match the document as long as they follow `slop` parameter.
- More terms you have, the higher slops you should set.
- Setting `slop` higher than usual might affect relevance because it affects relevance. BUt if you are fine with getting results without being concerned about the relevance, it is way to go.
