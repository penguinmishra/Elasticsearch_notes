# Highlighting matches in fields

- ES does highlighting using `highlight`
- `highlight` should contain fields we want to highlight.
- Otherwise we specify a highlighter. Highlighter named plain will be used which is sufficient in most cases.
```
PUT /highlighting/_doc/1
{
  "description": "Let me tell you a story about Elasticsearch. It's a full-text search engine that is built on Apache Lucene. It's really easy to use, but also packs lots of advanced features that you can use to tweak its searching capabilities. Lots of well-known and established companies use Elasticsearch, and so should you!"
}

GET /highlighting/_search
{
  "_source": false,
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": "Elasticsearch story"
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "fields": {
      "description": {}
    }
  }
}
```
The GET request gives:
```
[TRUNCATED]
"hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "highlighting",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.68324494,
        "highlight" : {
          "description" : [
            "Let me tell you a <em>story</em> about <em>Elasticsearch</em>.",
            "Lots of well-known and established companies use <em>Elasticsearch</em>, and so should you!"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]

- We get an object `highlight` which contains an array description which contains the fragment that match the query. The reason that we get array is that multiple parts or fragment might match the query.
- ES returns fragments because fields might be too long.
- `<em>` tags -> case of both `story` and `Elasticsearch` terms, This enables you to easily find the matches at the application level or just display the fragment directly to the user.
- But why do we need ES to wrap the matches within these tags other than for our convenience? We could have done this at the application level.
- No because ES analyses the queries which includes handling synonyms and stemming.
- If we talk about synoyms for example,
	- say we index a document containing term happy.
	- added a synonym: `"happy => delighted"`
	- restarted the node
	- searching for `delighted` would then match the document containing `happy`
	- But highlighting is handled automatically by ES because it highlights the original term at that position within the source document.

- Now, what happens BTS is:
	- ES performs a look up for the term `delighted` within the inverted index and finds a match because description field went through the same analysis process and in that process, term `happy` was replaced with `delighted`
	- Remember that the inverted index contains the offset for which the original term appeared within the source document.

	- so while the term delighted is stored within the inverted index, ES stores the offsets of the corresponding term (`happy` in our case) within the source document.
	- This enables the highlighter to wrap the original term within a tag even though it is entirely different term. So, even it is `delighted` in the inverted index, the term `happy` will be highlighted within the results.

- Same case is with stemming as well.

## How to wrap the matches within a different tag (other than the `<em>` tag

- That can be done by specifying `pre_tag` and `post_tag` parameters in the `highlight` object. These parameters could be arrays.
```
GET /highlighting/_search
{
  "_source": false,
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": "Elasticsearch story"
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "pre_tags": [ "<strong>" ],
    "post_tags": [ "</strong>" ], 
    "fields": {
      "description": {}
    }
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
[TRUNCATED]
"hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "highlighting",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.68324494,
        "highlight" : {
          "description" : [
            "Let me tell you a <strong>story</strong> about <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>.",
            "Lots of well-known and established companies use <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>, and so should you!"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
[TRUNCATED]
```
We can see that the `em` tags have been replaced by `<strong>` tags.
