- where spicy and sauce appear in the correct order, they have higher relevant score because the proximity in which the term appear affects the relevance score. Closer the proximity, higher the relevance score.
- Though there is no guarantee that the term appearing with lower proximiy have scored higher because a number of other factors are also taken into account while calculating the relavance score and term proximity is one of them. So don't expect terms to reflect relevance calculated only on basis of proximity.
- If we don't require all the terms to be present because relevance algorithm favours documents where most of the terms appear anyway.
- We can't do that with `match` query but if we want to boost the relevance score of a document based on the term proximity which the `match_phrase` query does. how do we get both of them? By combining both the queries in `bool` query:
- So, running query with only `match`:
```
GET /proximity/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "title": "spicy sauce"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
gives:
```

  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,

  },

      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.21585016,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.21585016,
        "_source" : {

        }
      },

      }
    ]

By combining the `match_phrase` query in it:
```
GET /proximity/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "title": "spicy sauce"
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match_phrase": {
            "title": {
              "query": "spicy sauce"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 84,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,

    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 5,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.43170032,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.43170032,
        "_source" : {

      {

        "_id" : "2",

        "_source" : {

        }
      },
      {

We can see that the documents have now better relevance score. But we can do better by including `slop` parameter:
```
GET /proximity/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "title": "spicy sauce"
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match_phrase": {
            "title": {
              "query": "spicy sauce",
              "slop": 5
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 79,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,

    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 5,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.43170032,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "proximity",

        "_source" : {

- Default boolean operator for match query is OR so both the terms are not required to be present within the document for it to be considered a match. The more the terms present, higher the relevance though.
- `min_should_match` can be specified for minimum terms to be matched.
- We can place an optional `match_phrase` query within `should` object as above for boosting the relevance score.
- With the `should` object query, the documents where two terms are next to each other receive boost.
- Specify `slop` parameter to boost in relevance.
