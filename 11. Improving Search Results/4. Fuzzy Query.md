# Fuzzy Query

** Fuzzy Queries are not analyzed!**
<br><br>

- Other than adding fuzziness parameter to a `match` query, we have a dedicated query named `fuzzy`.
- You can specify a `fuzziness` parameter in this query but that is optional and defaults to `auto` if not written explicitly.
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "fuzzy": {
      "name": {
        "value": "LOBSTER",
        "fuzziness": "auto"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Since we know that the `fuzzy` queries are not analyzed, the above query does not give any results because the term specified did not match in any inverted index.
- There is a difference between `match` query and `fuzzy` query - `match` queries are full text queries and are analyzed whereas `fuzzy` queries are term queries and are not analyzed.
- This is the reason why `match` queries with `fuzziness` parameter are preferred.
- If we change the term to lowercase, we would have same results as for the `match` query including the term oyster in the results:
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "fuzzy": {
      "name": {
        "value": "lobster",
        "fuzziness": "auto"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
[TRUNCATED]
 "name" : "Lobster - Live",
[TRUNCATED]
"name" : "Lobster - Baby Boiled",
[TRUNCATED]
"name" : "Lobster - Tail 6 Oz",
[TRUNCATED]
"name" : "Appetizer - Lobster Phyllo Roll",
[TRUNCATED]
"name" : "Lobster - Tail 3 - 4 Oz",
[TRUNCATED]
 "name" : "Sauce - Oyster",
 [TRUNCATED]
