# Adding Synonyms

- synonyms can be added at the time of index creation:
```
PUT /synonyms
{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "filter": {
        "my_synonym_filter": {
          "type": "synonym",
          "synonyms":[
            "awful => terrible",
            "awesome => great, super",
            "elasticsearch, logstash, kibana => elk",
            "weird, strange"
            ]
        }
      },
      "analyzer": {
        "my_analyzer": {
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "filter": ["lowercase","my_synonym_filter"]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "description": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "my_analyzer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- synonyms are to be specified in `filter` object's `synonyms` object.
- synonyms are array of string.
- terms mentioned in `synonyms` are mentioned with a mapping that the terms should be replaced with term(s).
- for example, `awful => terrible` would replace any ocurrence of awful with terrible.
- How synonyms work in ES:

![IMG1][IMG1]

- queries go through the same analysis process as in the mapping definition.
- terms level queries are not analyzed and searching `awful` with a term query will not fetch any results.

![IMG2][IMG2]

- So, don't combine synonyms with term level queries.
- How the synonyms can be added:
	- `1 => 2`
	- `1 => 2, 3` : stored at the same position in inverted index.
	- `1,2 => 3`
	- `1,2` : both the terms are stored at the same position in inverted index. No replacement happens in this case.

![IMG3][IMG3]

- Reason is that we still want to perform proximity search even when working with synonyms.
- Proximity query is a `match_phrase` query with a `slop` parameter.
- If ES placed synonyms at new positions within the inverted index, it would be effectively messing up the phrase queries.
- Order in which you define your token filters is important because they run in the order they are specified. We have `lowercase` filter before the `my_synonym_filter` filter.

![IMG4][IMG4]

- This means that the tokens that custom token filter receives are in lowercase here.
- Had we switched around their positions, the token filters (`my_synonym_filter` before `lowercase`) then synonym would no longer work with capitalized inputs.

![IMG5][IMG5]

- This is just one case where placement and order of token filters is important.
- Another case could be stemming. You'd want to place a synonym filter before stemming and generally as early as possible in the array with the exception of `lowercase` filter (`lowercase` should be tried to be placed first)
- Otherwise you'll need to account for all of the token filters when defining synonyms and that becomes hard to maintain when adding/removing token filters.
- Let's analyze some texts:
```
POST /synonyms/_analyze
{
  "analyzer": "my_analyzer", 
  "text": "Awesome"
}

POST /synonyms/_analyze
{
  "analyzer": "my_analyzer",
  "text": "Elasticsearch"
}

POST /synonyms/_analyze
{
  "analyzer": "my_analyzer",
  "text": "weirD"
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "tokens" : [
    {
      "token" : "great",
      "start_offset" : 0,
      "end_offset" : 7,
      "type" : "SYNONYM",
      "position" : 0
    },
    {
      "token" : "super",
      "start_offset" : 0,
      "end_offset" : 7,
      "type" : "SYNONYM",
      "position" : 0
    }
  ]
}
--------------------
{
  "tokens" : [
    {
      "token" : "elk",
      "start_offset" : 0,
      "end_offset" : 13,
      "type" : "SYNONYM",
      "position" : 0
    }
  ]
}
-------------------
{
  "tokens" : [
    {
      "token" : "weird",
      "start_offset" : 0,
      "end_offset" : 5,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 0
    },
    {
      "token" : "strange",
      "start_offset" : 0,
      "end_offset" : 5,
      "type" : "SYNONYM",
      "position" : 0
    }
  ]
}
```

- we can see that in the first case, great and super are placed at the same position, in the second one, even though we searched Elasticsearch, we get elk and in the third one when we searched weirD, we get two synonyms from inverted index which are weird and strange because they are stored together.

- Now, let's analyze one sentence:
```
POST /synonyms/_analyze
{
  "analyzer": "my_analyzer",
  "text": "Elasticsearch is awesome, but can also seem weird sometimes!."  
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "tokens" : [
    {
      "token" : "elk",
      "start_offset" : 0,
      "end_offset" : 13,
      "type" : "SYNONYM",
      "position" : 0
    },
    {
      "token" : "is",
      "start_offset" : 14,
      "end_offset" : 16,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 1
    },
    {
      "token" : "great",
      "start_offset" : 17,
      "end_offset" : 24,
      "type" : "SYNONYM",
      "position" : 2
    },
    {
      "token" : "super",
      "start_offset" : 17,
      "end_offset" : 24,
      "type" : "SYNONYM",
      "position" : 2
    },
    {
      "token" : "but",
      "start_offset" : 26,
      "end_offset" : 29,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 3
    },
    {
      "token" : "can",
      "start_offset" : 30,
      "end_offset" : 33,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 4
    },
    {
      "token" : "also",
      "start_offset" : 34,
      "end_offset" : 38,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 5
    },
    {
      "token" : "seem",
      "start_offset" : 39,
      "end_offset" : 43,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 6
    },
    {
      "token" : "weird",
      "start_offset" : 44,
      "end_offset" : 49,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 7
    },
    {
      "token" : "strange",
      "start_offset" : 44,
      "end_offset" : 49,
      "type" : "SYNONYM",
      "position" : 7
    },
    {
      "token" : "sometimes",
      "start_offset" : 50,
      "end_offset" : 59,
      "type" : "<ALPHANUM>",
      "position" : 8
    }
  ]
}
```

- We can see that for one term, we get multiple terms which comes from inverted index.
- Now let's put the sentence in a document:
```
POST /synonyms/_doc
{
  "description": "Elasticsearch is awesome, but can also seem weird sometimes"
}

PUT /synonyms/_doc/1
{
  "description": "Elasticsearch is awesome, but can also seem weird sometimes!"
}
```
and let's write a search query:
```
GET /synonyms/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": "great"
    }
  }
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "took" : 17,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.1969724,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "synonyms",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "-jj6j28BAoM8dotyeNyO",
        "_score" : 0.1969724,
        "_source" : {
          "description" : "Elasticsearch is awesome, but can also seem weird sometimes"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "synonyms",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.1969724,
        "_source" : {
          "description" : "Elasticsearch is awesome, but can also seem weird sometimes!"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If we try searching awesome:
```
GET /synonyms/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": "awesome!"
    }
  }
}
```
We get:
```
{
  "took" : 0,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 0.26420254,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "synonyms",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "-jj6j28BAoM8dotyeNyO",
        "_score" : 0.26420254,
        "_source" : {
          "description" : "Elasticsearch is awesome, but can also seem weird sometimes"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "synonyms",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 0.26420254,
        "_source" : {
          "description" : "Elasticsearch is awesome, but can also seem weird sometimes!"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
