# Adding synonyms from file

- if we have a lot of synonyms, we can specify the path of the file containing synonyms in the `filter` of `analysis` with `synonyms_path` parameter:

```
PUT /synonyms
{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "filter": {
        "my_synonym_filter":{
          "type": "synonym",
          "synonyms_path" : "analysis/synonyms.txt"
        }
      }, 
      "analyzer": {
        "my_analyzer": {
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "filter": ["lowercase", "my_synonym_filter"]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "description":{
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "my_analyzer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- file should be a text file containing teh same format for a synonym.
- path coud be an abosulte path or  relative path to config directory of the node.
- navigation to the config directory either with docker/local
- config/analysis/text file
	- file could be like below:
	```
	awful => terrible
	awesome => great, super
	elasticsearch, logstash, kibana => elk
	weird, strange
	```
- one rule per line in the text file.
- restart the node before running the query and delete the index if it already exists.
- analyze a text:
```
POST /synonyms/_analyze
{
  "analyzer": "my_analyzer",
  "text": "Elasticsearch"
}
```
This gives:
```
{
  "tokens" : [
    {
      "token" : "elk",
      "start_offset" : 0,
      "end_offset" : 13,
      "type" : "SYNONYM",
      "position" : 0
    }
  ]
}
```
Which is as expected.
- synonyms should be available on all nodes storing documents for index using the analyzer.
- If you add new synonyms to the file and restart the nodes you might think that everything is good to go, but you might already have indexed documents containing whichever synonym you are adding.
- example:
	- added document containing term `elasticsearch`
	- added synonym(s) `elasticsearch => elk` afterwards
	- restart the node and expect everything to be good.
	- but if we perform a search query for `elasticsearch`, it won't match anything.

- Reason:
	- at the time of adding the document, there is no synonym for the term `elasticsearch`. So the term is added just as it is to the inverted index.
	- when a synonym is added, that synonym is effective immediate after restarting node but only indexing new documents or updating existing ones.
	- That is because ES picks new synonyms when restarting node but it does not reindex the existing documents.
	- at this point, inverted index contains term `elasticsearch` which we are searching for. So, why does it not match?
	
![IMG2][IMG2]

	- Because the search query goes through the same analysis process as full text fields do.
	- a part of that process is to look for synonym(s).
	- So instead of searching `elasticsearch` we are searching for `elk` BTS.
	- and since inverted index contains the term `elasticsearch`, the document won't match.

- Solution
	- update by query API- `POST /synonyms/_update_by_query`
	- after doing that, the document should match becayse the documents have been reindexed.
