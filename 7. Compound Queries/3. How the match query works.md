# How the `match` query works

- `match` query uses internally default operator `or` with the option to change it to `and`
- `match` query constructs a `bool` query internally as part of the analysis process after the query has been analysed by the field's analyzers.
- token resulting from the analysis process are added as `term` queries inside a `bool` query. This means that the `match` query is just a convenient wrapper around the `bool` query.
- let's write some `match` queries and their `bool` counterparts to check it:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "pasta carbonara"
    }
  }
}
```
which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 2,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 9,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 4.54881,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "recipe",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "8",
        "_score" : 4.54881,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Vegan Carbonara Pasta",
		  [TRUNCATED]
```
- the default operator for the `match` query is `or`. So this query translates to below `bool` query:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "term": {
            "title": "pasta"
          }
        },
        {
          "term": {
           "title": "carbonara"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
which gives exactly the same result.

- if we change the first `match` query to operator `and`, the query will search for documents having titles with both the terms. The default `or` would be overridden by `and`:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "pasta carbonara",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
which gives:
```
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 4.54881,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "recipe",
        "_type" : "_doc",
        "_id" : "8",
        "_score" : 4.54881,
        "_source" : {
          "title" : "Vegan Carbonara Pasta",
		  [TRUNCATED]
```
- the equivalent for this query would be a `bool` query with each `term` in a must object:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool":{
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "title": "pasta"
          }
        },
        {
          "match": {
            "title": "carbonara"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
which gives exactly the same results.

- while using `match` queries, `term` queries are constructed using the analysis process. So, from `match` 	query, the terms are analyzed and then the internal `bool` query is constructed BTS. So, uppercase in `match` query won't matter.
- However, this becomes a problem if we directly pass uppercase in `term` queries. Since terms queries are not analyzed, they are searched as they are.
- `match` query with uppercase:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "Pasta Carbonara"
    }
  }
}
```
- whereas, the uppercase in `term` won't be analysed:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "term": {
            "title": "Pasta" 
        }
        },
        {
          "term" : {
            "title": "Carbonara"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
gives:
```
{
  "took" : 0,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 0,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : null,
    "hits" : [ ]
  }
}
```
because `term` queries are not analyzed!
