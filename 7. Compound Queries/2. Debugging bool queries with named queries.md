# Debugging bool queries with named queries

- `explain` API is helpful in understanding for why or why not a document matched a query.
- similar to that, for `bool` queries, we use named queries.
- this is helpful in determining which query clauses the document matched. Obviously it is not required for `must`, `must_not` or `filter` queries.
- becomes useful in determining which `should` clauses matched to make sense of results.
- use `_name` to each query clause and give it a name:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": {
              "query": "parmesan",
              "_name": "parmesan_must"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "must_not": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": {
              "query": "tuna",
              "_name": "tuna_must_not"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": {
              "query": "parsley",
              "_name": "parsley_should"
            }
          }
        }
      ], 
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15,
              "_name": "prep_time_range"
            }
          }  
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

this gives in result:
```
"matched_queries" : [
          "parmesan_must",
          "prep_time_range",
          "parsley_should"
        ]
```
and
```
"matched_queries" : [
          "parmesan_must",
          "prep_time_range"
        ]
```
for the documents matched.
