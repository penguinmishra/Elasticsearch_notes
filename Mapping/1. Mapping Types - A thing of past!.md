# Mapping Types
- The mapping types were used in previous versions of ES but will be removed in version 8.x.
- They are already deprecated.
- Pretty much all the ES APIs have changed. So, whenever you see `default` as part of an endpoint, this refers to the mapping type.
- Some APIs now use `_doc` instead of `default` while others completely got rid of `default`.
