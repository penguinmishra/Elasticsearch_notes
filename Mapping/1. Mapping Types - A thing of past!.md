# Mapping Types
- The mapping types were used in previous versions of ES but will be removed in version 8.x.
- They are already deprecated.
- Pretty much all the ES APIs have changed. So, whenever you see <code>default</code> as part of an endpoint, this refers to the mapping type.
- Some APIs now use <code>\_doc</code> instead of <code>default</code> while others completely got rid of <code>default</code>.
