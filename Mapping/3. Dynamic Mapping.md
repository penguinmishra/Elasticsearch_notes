# DYNAMIC MAPPING

- mapping can be defined explicitly when we tell ES what to do with the document when we store them.
- Dynamic mapping means that no or only some mappings are defined explicitly.
- ES automatically adds mapping to fields which do not have mapping defined.
- This is done by inspecting types of fields to be stored.
- for example, if you add a new field created and the format given matches the date format, then ES maps it to type date datatype.
- similarly, if you supply values as true/false, ES automatically maps them to data type boolean.
- All of this happens BTS when adding documents and indices.
![How Dynamic Mapping Works][dynmapurl]
When we run:
```
GET /products/_mappings
```
this gives:
```
{
  "products" : {
    "mappings" : {
      "properties" : {
        "created" : {
          "type" : "date",
          "format" : "yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy/MM/dd||epoch_millis"
        },
        "description" : {
          "type" : "text",
          "fields" : {
            "keyword" : {
              "type" : "keyword",
              "ignore_above" : 256
            }
          }
        },
        "in_stock" : {
          "type" : "long"
        },
        "is_active" : {
          "type" : "boolean"
        },
        "name" : {
          "type" : "text",
          "fields" : {
            "keyword" : {
              "type" : "keyword",
              "ignore_above" : 256
            }
          }
        },
        "price" : {
          "type" : "long"
        },
        "script" : {
          "properties" : {
            "source" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "fields" : {
                "keyword" : {
                  "type" : "keyword",
                  "ignore_above" : 256
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "sold" : {
          "type" : "long"
        },
        "tags" : {
          "type" : "text",
          "fields" : {
            "keyword" : {
              "type" : "keyword",
              "ignore_above" : 256
            }
          }
        },
        "upsert" : {
          "properties" : {
            "in_stock" : {
              "type" : "long"
            },
            "name" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "fields" : {
                "keyword" : {
                  "type" : "keyword",
                  "ignore_above" : 256
                }
              }
            },
            "price" : {
              "type" : "long"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**NOTE** : 
```
GET /products/_mappings
```
could be:
```
GET /products/default/_mappings
```
for older versions. If you run this in a newer version, you will get:
```
{
  "error": "Incorrect HTTP method for uri [/products/default/_mappings?pretty] and method [GET], allowed: [PUT, POST]",
  "status": 405
}
```
- for types, you may provide your own format to match or even disable detection of data type. This is provided [here][dynamic_date_detection].
- The above URL gives an example for date.

- Note, that in_stock field is mapped as `long` data type.
- ES uses `long` data type for integers by default. Since it has no way of knowing on how large numbers you might want to store.

- Special is the way `text` fields are treated.
- Note that, the `name` and `description` are mapped as `text`.
- Apart from `type`, they have `fields` property containing `keyword` with a `type` `keyword`. This means that field has two mappings. However, the field may have multiple mappings. By default, each text field is mapped using `"type" : "text"` and `"type" : "keyword"`.
- `"type" : "text"` is used for full text searches. while `"type" : "keyword"` is used for exact matches used in aggregation. and such.
