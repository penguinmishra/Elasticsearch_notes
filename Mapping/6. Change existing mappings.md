# Change existing mappings

Mappings for existing index cannot be done. If you want to do that, delete the index and recreate it:

```
DELETE /products
```
And then:
```
PUT /products
{
	"mappings": {
		"dynamic": false,
		"properties":{
			"in_stock": {
				"type":"integer"
			},
			"is_active": {
				"type":"boolean"
			},
			"price": {
				"type": "integer"
			},
			"sold": {
				"type": "long"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

There are few exceptions to the rule that mappings cannot be updated.
- You can add new properties for the field data type object.
- You can add additional mappings to additional fields. for example: adding `keyword` type for a `text` field:
```
"description" : {
          "type" : "text",
          "fields" : {
            "keyword" : {
              "type" : "keyword",
              "ignore_above" : 256
            }
          }
        }
```
-Other than these exceptions, you must delete the index and recreate it.
