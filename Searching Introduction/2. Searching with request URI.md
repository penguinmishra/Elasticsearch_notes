## Searching with request URI

- This is not used widely but comes in handy while developing.
```
GET /products/_search?q=*
```
Here `products` is the index name and `*` is used to match everything.<br>
Not all the documents will be returned because the data would be huge and this could be controlled by `size` parameter. The `size` is common to both the request URI and search DSL.<br>

To get specific matches, the `*` could be replaced by more specifications:
```
GET /products/_search?q=name:Tuna
```
Even the arrays could be searched. For example:
```
GET /products/_search?q=tags=Meat
```
Similarly, the boolean operands like AND and OR could be used:
```
GET /products/_search?q=tags=Meat AND name:Lobster
```
In cURL, however, you need to replace `AND` with `%20`. Kibana does this internally for us.<br>
