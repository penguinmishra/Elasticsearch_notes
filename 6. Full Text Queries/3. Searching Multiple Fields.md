# Searching Multiple Fields
- Use `multi_match`
- specify an array of fields to search through
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "pasta",
      "fields": ["title", "description"]
    }
  }
}
```
the above query searches through `title` and `description` fields for the term `pasta`. The results will have the term `pasta` in either of the fields or in both.
- two terms appearing in one field has more relevance than one term appearing in both the fields.
