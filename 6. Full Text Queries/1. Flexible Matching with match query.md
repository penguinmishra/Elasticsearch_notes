# Flexible Matching with `match` query

When it comes to full text search, match queries can be used:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "Recipes with pasta and spaghetti"
    }
  }
}
```
which gives results where first result has *spaghetti* twice and *pasta* once while second result has only one *pasta* and no spaghetti. The reason for this is that the match queries are boolean queries and use `or` operator internally. The words such as the, of, this have lower relevance because of IDF.<br><br>
The default operator can be changed by using `operator` keyword:
```

GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "Recipes with pasta and spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Which gives us no results because now we are searching for all of the terms mentioned in `query` to be present in `title` field.
