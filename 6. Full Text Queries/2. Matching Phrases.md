# Matching Phrases

In match query, the terms are searched in no specific order. But if you want to search sequences of words, that can be done with `match_phrase`:
```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": "spaghetti puttanesca"
    }
  }
}
```
This query searches for title where `spaghetti puttanesca` appear in a phrase. If we interchange or change places of words in phrase in `match_phrase` query such as above, the ES will try to search the phrase which might not match. Order of terms matter in `match_phrase` queries.
